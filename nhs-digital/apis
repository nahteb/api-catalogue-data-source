In some cases consent can also be obtained from a lasting power of attorney for health and welfare or a court appointed deputy.details of impairments, which enable clinicians to understand the range of adjustments the patient may require.

This API can only be used by relevant health and care staff providing direct care, authenticated with an NHSsmartcardor equivalent. The existance of a flag is intended to be visible to all staff who have access to the patient record.  The contents of the Flag may only be visible to clinical staff - as determined by role-based access controls (RBAC). For more details seeRegistration authorities and smartcards.
